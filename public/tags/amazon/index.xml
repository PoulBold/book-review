&lt;p&gt;After more than ten years of publishing and selling books on Amazon, I’ve noticed a pattern that stays the same no matter how much the platform changes. As authors, we look at our listings through the lens of everything we’ve poured into them. We focus on the polished cover we worked on for weeks, the title we rewrote a dozen times, and the description we refined until every sentence felt right. To us, these elements represent months — sometimes years — of effort, creativity, and personal investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
